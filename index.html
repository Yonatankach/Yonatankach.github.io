        <h2 id="1">lesson 1</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>
        Learned about the h's (headings), p's          (paragraphs) and br's (break) which is like pressing enter 
        </li>
        <li>
        Learned em <em>(emphasis)</em> which italics it and <strong>strong</strong> which makes it bold 
        </li>
        <li>
        Learned how to do lists. theres ol (ordered list) which numbers the list items and ul (unordered list) which just has a dot. inside them you do li (list item) to put content
        </li>
           <li> 
           Learned how to add images. you use img and inside the &lt; &gt; you do src ="the image address". After you can do alt= "text" for mans whos computers dont see the picture and then width= "random number".
        </li>
         </ol>
         
     <h2 id="2">lesson 2</h2>
   <p>
     Learned how to use style. if you want to change a specific area you do <br><br>
     'whatever thing you wanna change (ex: h,p,#somerandomid, .somerandomclass)' { <br> 
     'property u want to change' : 'what you want it to be'<br> }<br>
     you need to have the id in the body too so for example it will be h2 id= "id's name"
    <br> so theres (changed with)
     </p><ul>
     <li>color (ex:rgb(199, 119, 199)) 
    </li><li>background-color (same as color)</li>
 </ul>
     
<p></p>
<h2 id="3">lesson 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Learned how to make links. You use a (anchor a link) and inside the &lt; &gt; you do href (hyper reference) = "the link". and of course end it with /a <br>
you can also tell it where to open the link using tagret="" . there is _blank which is a new tab _self which is same tab (target is used before href)
</li>
<li>
you can do the same thing linking something on the same page. you do this by writing the id of the of what you want to link to in the href= "" instead of a link
</li>
<li>
tables. its hella complicated so ima make it <br> table <br> <br>
  thead (table head)<br>
   tr (table row) <br>
    th (header cell)<br>
    th (as many header cells as you need)<br>
   /tr <br>
  /thead  <br>
that sets up the table but to actually add rows you need <br> 
 tbody (table body)<br> 
   tr (table row)<br> 
    td (tabular data) <br>
    td (as many collums as you have to fill out) <br>  
   /tr <br>
   tr (anothe row)<br> 
    td (tabular data) <br>
    td (as many collums as you have to fill out) <br>
   /tr <br>
 /tbody<br>
/table
</li>
<li> 
u can add comments using <!-- woops dis actually making a comment--> &lt;!--comment u want to make--&gt;
</li>
</ol>
 <h2 id="4">lesson 4</h2>
 <ol>
 <li> 
 font family property same as <a href="chrome://new-tab-page/#2">lesson 2</a> <br> it looks like<br> font-family: 'what font family you want' or "if its a specific name.<br>if you put a font not all computers have, you can make a backup font if you use a comma and add another font
  </li>
 <li>
 some examples of font families are <br> 
 <ul>
 <li>sans-serif</li>
 <li>serif</li>
 <li>fantasy</li>
 <li>monospace</li>
 <li>cursive</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li> 
 you can also change the font size using <br>
 font-size: _____ <br>
 you can use either px (pixels) for em which how much you want to multiply the default size by (ex:13px, 1.5em) 
 </li>
 <li> 
 you can have the style or weight be italica or bold instead of actually bolding or italicising everything. <br>
 you can do <br> 
 font-style: italics <br>
 or <br>
 font-weight: bold <br>
 but if you want to do fonts with speed you can just type <br>
 font: (fontstyle) (size) (fontname) <br>
 example: font: italic 13px fantasy;.
  </li>
  <li>
  there are a bunch more properties for fonts <br>
  <ul>
  <li>
  line-height: 1.5em (vertical spacing in between lines
  </li>
   <li>
  text-align: right, center, justify
  </li>
    <li>
  text-decoration: underline, none (if you want to remove from links for example(you would do it under a))
  </li>
    <li>
  text-align: right, center, justify
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
 </ol>
